# Comp90043-X3DH-DoubleRatchet

Code for Unimelb Comp90043 cryptography research project.

The topic is on: 

Implement and evaluate a key exchange protocol based on X3DH and
Double Ratchet (like Signal Protocol). X3DH provides forward secrecy
and cryptographic deniability. Double Ratchet gives some protection
to earlier or later encrypted messages in case of a compromise of a
partyâ€™s keys. Also Analysis of its performance overhead.
